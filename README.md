# **local_volume_database** 

### DESCRIPTION:

Database of local volume dwarf galaxies and MW star clusters. The database is limited to galaxies with resolved stars and this is currently set by HST to D ~ 3-10 Mpc, but this distance will increase with JWST.  The star cluster collections are limited to star cluster/globular clusters in the MW halo and does not include open clusters.  

The main data tables are in the data/ folder in csv and fits format. In addition, there is a summary table made from the database at table/lvdb_table.pdf .

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
