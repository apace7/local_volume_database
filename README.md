# **local_volume_database** 

### DESCRIPTION:

Database of local volume dwarf galaxies and MW star clusters. The database is limited to galaxies with resolved stars and this is currently set by HST to D ~ 3-10 Mpc, but this distance will increase with JWST.  The star cluster collections are limited to star cluster/globular clusters in the MW halo and does not include open clusters.  

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

If you use this in your research please include a link to the github repository (https://github.com/apace7/local_volume_database) and cite the database paper (once it is written).

### INSTALLATION:
Todo.

The data is available as csv files (and other files)
