# **local_volume_database** 

### DESCRIPTION:

Database of local volume galaxies and star clusters. The database limit is galaxies with resolved stars. The limit is currently set by HST (D ~ 3-10 Mpc), but this distance will increase with JWST.  The star cluster collections are limited to new star cluster/globular clusters (post Harris 1996), primarily in the MW halo.
