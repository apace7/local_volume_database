notes:
  - Previously this system was internally referred to as des\_sag\_2 by ABP.
  - False positive based on the lack of detection in DES year 3 search \citep{DrlicaWagner2020ApJ...893...47D}.
  - False positive based on the the lack of an expected Gaia DR2 proper motion search \citep{Pace2019ApJ...875...77P, McConnachie2020AJ....160..124M}.
  - In the discovery paper ``DES J0225+0304 will be named Cetus III if found to be a dwarf galaxy'' \citep{Luque2017MNRAS.468...97L}. This name is not included in the other name column as there is another dwarf galaxy now known as Cetus III.
