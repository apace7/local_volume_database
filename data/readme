table descriptions (tab/sheet)
dwarf_mw : Milky Way dwarf galaxies
dwarf_m31: M31 dwarf galaxies
gc_ufsc: post Harris catalog star clusters in the MW halo (abs(b) > ~5-10)
dwarf_local_field: dwarf galaxies outside of MW/M31 to ~ 3 Mpc, mostly follows McConnachie 2012
name_discovery: key, discovery year, discovery reference, name, and alternative names

columns:
key: unique identifier for each object
rhalf: half-light radius (or plummer radius) in arcmin
ellipticity: 1 - minor/major axis (or 1 - axis ratio)
position_angle: N->E (degree)
distance: kpc units
rhalf_physical: rhalf * distance in parsec
rhalf_sph_physical: rhalf * distance * sqrt(1-ellipticity) in parsec
vlos_systemic, vlos_sigma: km/s
metallicity: spectroscopic metallicity (generally)
pmra (etc): proper motion from Gaia DR3 mas/yr
rcore, rking: profile fits with king profile in arcmin
age: Gyr units
metallicity_photometric: metallicity isochrone fitting
flux_HI: (  Jy km sâˆ’1 ), this is a relatively new column and mostly incomplete

error columns: _em = error minus = minus 1 sigma (or 16% confidence interval) and similarly for _ep
_ul = upper limit at 95% confidence interval (some are 90% or 84%, the goal is to make it consistent)
