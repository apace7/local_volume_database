key,notes
eridanus_3,observed mass segration in Baumgardt2022MNRAS.510.3531B; there is potential metallicity dispersion in CaH\&K photometry but main sequence stars are included in this calculation Fu2023arXiv230606260F; size + luminosity is consistent with both GC and dwarf; no published spectroscopy; classifiction unclear
draco_2,observed mass segration in Baumgardt2022MNRAS.510.3531B; there is potential metallicity dispersion in CaH\&K photometry but main sequence stars are included in this calculation Fu2023arXiv230606260F; no spectroscopic metallicity dispersion or velocity dispersion Longeard2020MNRAS.491..356L; size is large for star cluster
des_sag_2,note that this object is referred to as Cetus III in the discovery paper if it is a dwarf Luque2017MNRAS.468...97L but a second system found in the HSC survey has the Cetus III name Homma2018PASJ...70S..18H
