# Contributions, Support, and Issues

Please report any bugs, issues, or suggestions by opening a ['GitHub issue'](https://github.com/apace7/local_volume_database/issues/new). Generally, questions and comments will lead to more comprehensive documentation and a better catalog.

For contributions, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Contributions of all types are welcome. Expanding the LVDB with new measurements, new types of measurements, and new systems will make the LVDB more useful for the community.
For more details, see the [`contributing section on readthedocs`](https://local-volume-database.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html).
